# <u>**MMU details for correct install**</u>
before installing Happy-Hare V2 you must

Uninstall the old ercf ERCF-Software-V3 (if you already have it):
1. backup your old ercf_***.cfg files for future reference,
1. Cleanly REMOVE ERCF-Software-V3:
```
~/ERCF-Software-V3/install.sh -u
rm -rf ~/ERCF-Software-V3
```

and install the "new" Happy Hare V2 by following instructions in https://github.com/moggieuk/Happy-Hare:
```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/moggieuk/Happy-Hare.git
cd Happy-Hare

./install.sh -i
```

Finally, Klippain requires a few simple steps to configure and customize it for your printer: please follow the [configuration guide](./configuration.md).

# <u>**Some loose details:**</u>

- <u>**MMU check Gates on Start Print:**</u>

&nbsp;&nbsp;I recommend to set your `variable_mmu_check_gates_on_start_print` to `True` in your Klippain `variables.cfg` file.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-> But take in mind that you also must add in your slicer start g_code the parameter `TOOLS_USED=!referenced_tools!` used by the [HHv2 moonraker gcode preprocessor](https://github.com/moggieuk/Happy-Hare/blob/main/doc/gcode_preprocessing.md). Otherwise, only the INITIAL TOOL will be checked and if the gates used have previously been marked as empty an error may occur during printing!!!

- <u>**Difference between GATE and TOOL:**</u>

&nbsp;&nbsp;The `GATE` designates the hardware MMU selector spool.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;The `TOOL` designates the software MMU tool use to call the filament by the `Tx` command.  
In HHv2, by default, GATE=TOOL. To see your current config use the `MMU_REMAP_TTG` command.  
But it's possible to remap that if you want with `MMU_REMAP_TTG TOOL=x GATE=y`, or for complete remaping (example for a 6 gates MMU to completely reverse the order of all tools): `MMU_REMAP_TTG MAP=5,4,3,2,1,0` command.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-> See the complete description of the [Tool-to-Gate (TTG) mapping](https://github.com/moggieuk/Happy-Hare/blob/main/README.md#3-tool-to-gate-ttg-mapping).

If you have this message at bootup in the console you must check your Klippain variables in `variables.cfg` !!! 

    - variable_mmu_force_homing_in_start_print: True or False
    - variable_mmu_unload_on_cancel_print: True or False
    - variable_mmu_unload_on_end_print: True or False
    - variable_mmu_check_gates_on_start_print: True or False

If the gate is "correctly" loaded and this error appears, this is generally due to the fact that the gate was previously marked as empty and its state has not been updated.
To correct during print for example you can use the command: `MMU_GATE_MAP GATE=1 AVAILABLE=1` (adapt for your GATE number...)

a good practice is to check the gates state after make changes in filaments with the command `MMU_GATE_MAP` to be sure all your setup is correct.  
The command `MMU_CHECK_GATES` can update the MAP for all MMU gates. But you can also use for exemple `MMU__CHECK_GATES GATE="0 2 5"` to check and update only gates 0, 2 and 5.
